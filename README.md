# DinoProject - NEAT-Powered Dinosaur Evolution

Welcome to the DinoProject, an project where I use NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) in Python to teach dinosaurs to evolve and excel in the world of endless running.

## Project Overview

DinoProject is a Python-based gaming project inspired by the classic "Chrome Dinosaur Game," where players control a dinosaur to avoid obstacles. However, this project adds a unique twist: the dinosaurs are not controlled by the player directly but are instead trained using NEAT to autonomously improve their running and obstacle-dodging skills.

## Features

- **NEAT-Powered Evolution:** Utilizes the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) Python library to evolve and train virtual dinosaurs to excel in the game.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Generation:** The game generates a variety of obstacles such as cacti for the evolving dinosaurs to dodge.
- **Score and Speed Tracking:** Tracks the score and game speed, which increases over time, making the game progressively challenging.
- **Generation Counter:** Displays the current generation to monitor the progress of the evolving dinosaurs.
- **Customizable Skins and Names:** Dinosaurs can be customized with different skins and names.

## How It Works

1. Virtual dinosaurs are trained using NEAT to autonomously make decisions based on their environment and genetic makeup.
2. The game environment includes a running track and obstacles, and the dinosaurs aim to maximize their score by avoiding obstacles.
3. As the game progresses, the dinosaurs improve their abilities through evolutionary algorithms.
4. The player can watch the dinosaurs evolve and compete against each other to achieve the highest score.

## Getting Started

To run the DinoProject and observe the evolution of the dinosaurs, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies, including `pygame` and `neat-python`.
2. Adjust the NEAT configuration file (`config-feedforward.txt`) to fine-tune the learning parameters if desired.
3. Execute the `main.py` script to start the game and observe the evolutionary process.

Happy evolving and gaming with the DinoProject!
